 *
 * LEGACY ROUTE — kept only so any Meta App Dashboard still pointing at the old
 * callback URL (https://crm.kosmicfurniture.com/api/webhooks/facebook) keeps
 * working. All real logic now lives in /api/social/webhook, which correctly
 * resolves the customer's display name (first_name + last_name) and supports
 * both Facebook Pages and Instagram in one place.
 *
 * Please update the Meta webhook callback URL to:
 *   https://crm.kosmicfurniture.com/api/social/webhook
